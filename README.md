# Presentations
A directory where I put various machine learning presentations I gave at universities

1) IEEESB17_02_LogReg - a jupyter notebook, which explains by doing logistic and softmax regression. I gave the lecture for the Data Science and Network Science IEEE group at Ca' Foscari.

2) Deep Learning.pdf  - a presentation on deep learning. I gave the lecture on the Machine Learning course at Ca' Foscari. (slides are a bit outdated)

3) DL Lecture.pdf     - the first part of the lecture deals with making deep learning works well (advices on deep learning). Use Adam isn't anymore my recommendation (use SGD instead)
			the second part is an intro on RNN. I gave the lecture on the Machine Learning course at Ca' Foscari.

4) Relaxation Labelling ZHAW - a lecture on relaxation labelling and its connection with deep learning. I gave the lecture on ZHAW university, Switzerland.
